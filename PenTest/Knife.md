Knife

# Knife

- Knife is a command-line tool that provides an interface between a local chef-repo and the Chef server.



## Exploit

- The command `knife exec` can be used to with the -E flag to execute a ruby string or can be pointed to a ruby script. Have seen examples where in the sudoers file users have access to run knife no password. This can lead to an easy escalation of privileges.
